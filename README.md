# Mumbai_Trains_All_Accounments_Python
This repository is announcements of all railway trains passing through Mumbai railway station in .mp3 form. I collect the real time data of railways and convert it into xlsx file. In main.py I made .mp3 files to announce the train coming and going event. I used pyaudio, pydub, pandas, gtts in this.
In this I generated random platform numbers because platform not fixed all the time it chnages.
In my xlsx file data present more than 900 so all 900 trains .mp3 creation possible but it effect on cpu performence so i remove .mp3 announcements only few are present in this.
But if your laptop is efficient to hold all .mp3 you can use Mumbai_trains.xlsx or any file you want...
If you need to generate announcements rather than mumbai trains just change the xlsx file to your city trains file and generate announcements.
